# Aurora

This is a simple Rails app that can be used as a base to set up your own
online store. Remember, **simple** is the keyword here. This is meant as
an easy starting point with minimal product and customer management.

## Payment Processing

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api/ruby) to process
payments. Stripe is awesome.

## Shipping Integration

Currently no shipping integration is supported. This is a small project.
Shipping is not simple.

## License

Aurora is published under the wonderful MIT License. Basically, do
whatever you want with this code, just make sure to credit me somewhere.
